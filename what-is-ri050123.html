                    Reactive inhibition (RI) is probably a phenomenon that you’ve
                    never heard of. It’s simply a factor that worsens your performance
                    as you keep practicing. There are two factors that influence it:
                    the amount of time or repetitions you’ve done and the length of
                    breaks.Let’s examine the graph below. Let’s imagine your goal is
                    to play a scale as fast as possible, thus as you practice more,
                    you generally learn more. This is reflected in the gray line.
                    However, you are not always able to express everything you learn
                    and this is reflected in the red line. There is a difference between
                    your true achieved skill, what you’ve learned, and your actual
                    performance. As the graph shows, the more time you practice without
                    taking a break, the greater the level of RI you have is shown in the
                    red line. If you take a break, it dissipates and you restore your
                    performance ability at the beginning of the next trial. <br /> <br />
                </p>

                    The important takeaway from here is that more breaks and shorter
                    practice bouts is better for performance. One thing this graph doesn’t
                    suggest is that RI has an effect on your achieved skill level. If this
                    were the case, it is possible that long practice periods with few breaks
                    would be as effective as short practice periods with long breaks. <br /> <br />

                    I conducted a study to test the question if the amount of RI affected
                    the amount learned. I had two groups, group A performed a lot of repetitions
                    of a motor sequence (25) during a trial and had short breaks (10 s). Group B
                    performed a few repetitions (5) during the trial and had long breaks (30 s).
                    We equated the total number of repetitions between the two groups. Thus, group
                    A had a lot of RI during practice and group B had very little. After 175 completed
                    sequences, there was a 15 minute rest period where the participants performed
                    double digit addition. The purpose of this rest period was to fully dissipate
                    all of the accumulated RI, thus after rest we would have a much more true measure
                    of the underlying achieved skill for both groups. After the rest, we had both
                    groups do the exact same task where both A & B performed 5 repetitions and had 30 s
                    breaks. This again ensured that we were measuring a true reflection of their skill. <br /> <br />

                    What we see in the graph below is that before the rest (dotted line) is that there
                    is a clear difference in performance between the two groups. However, after rest,
                    when both groups are performing the same task, they have equivalent performance.
                    This suggests that RI does not have an effect on learning rates in simple motor
                    sequence learning tasks. <br /> <br />

                    What does this mean for when you’re practicing the piano? For learning scales,
                    you can power through practicing one scale at a time, taking breaks only when you
                    feel like you need to. At the same time being aware that your performance will degrade,
                    which can be demotivating if you don’t take enough breaks. <br /> <br />

                    Well, this comes with a few caveats. In piano practice, your goal isn’t to play
                    something as fast as you can, your goal is to play to a specific rhythm. Thus you can
                    make two types of errors: pressing the wrong note, and timing errors. From this study,
                    we know that RI doesn’t affect your learning for which note to press in a scale, however,
                    it’s unclear if it affects the learning of rhythm and timing. The other caveat is that it’s
                    not optimal to repeatedly practice the same scale over and over again because of the
                    interleaving effect. It’s more optimal to have a practice schedule like scale A, scale B,
                    then scale C, and back to scale A, etc. In the next blog post, I’ll talk about why that is
                    and how to implement it into your piano practice. <br /> <br />
