                    When Does Motor Learning Occur?
                </h2>
                <p class=text>
                    When does motor learning occur? Intuitively, like declarative learning, one would think that it
                    would occur concurrently with the task. However, for the past 20 years, researchers have been
                    proponents that motor learning can occur offline (not concurrently with the task). We’ll call this
                    the consolidation account. This account has been supported by the repeated finding that there are
                    performance improvements after rest, whether after sleeping (e.g. 12 hours), 5 minutes, or most
                    recently, 10 seconds. Some researchers have gone so far to say that “much, if not all” motor
                    learning occurs offline [1-3]. However, our lab, along with others , have shown that the evidence
                    for motor learning occurring during sleep is scant [4-8]. In this study, we set out to provide an
                    alternative account to the claim that learning occurs during a 300 s rest period. <br><br>

                    A core factor that has been ignored in studies claiming that learning occurs during offline periods
                    is reactive inhibition (RI). RI is the worsening of performance as online task time continues. RI
                    builds up as online task time increases and dissipates during breaks between trials. The more RI
                    there is, the worse the performance. The current study set out to test both the RI account and the
                    consolidation account as an explanation for post-rest improvements after 5 minutes. <br><br>

                    We did this in a standard finger tapping task where participants repeatedly typed 4-1-3-2-4 for
                    either 10 s or 30 s trials. Between trials, participants either had 10 s or 30 s breaks (figure 1).
                    After 360 s of practice, participants had a “break” of 300 s where they performed double digit
                    addition. After, participants performed the same finger tapping task for 60 s. <br><br>

                    Figure 1. Participants repeatedly typed 4-1-3-2-4 over trial. They were randomly assigned to one of
                    four groups with either 10 or 30 s trial lengths and either 10 or 30 s break lengths. <br><br>

                    We replicated past findings of RI during the task (e.g. the worsening of reaction time during the
                    trial in figure 2a). We found that both on-task trial time and break time significantly affected the
                    amount of post-rest increase. As predicted by the RI account, the longer the trial and the shorter
                    the breaks, the greater the post-rest improvement and vice-versa (figure 2b). With a novel
                    additional assumption to the consolidation account, it too was able to predict a similar pattern of
                    results. Also of note, we found evidence that RI exists in the 10 s on-task trial, 10 s break group.
                    This is the same group used in Bönstrup et al., (2020) and Buch et al. (2021), which raises the
                    possibility that their claims of learning during 10 s breaks may in fact be due to the accrual and
                    dissipation of RI. <br><br>

                    Our findings add to the mounting evidence that challenges a 20 year old idea that motor learning can
                    occur offline. <br><br>

                    Figure 2. A) Each point represents 10 seconds of on-task trial time. In the 30 s on-task trial time
                    condition, the triangles connected by lines are not separated by breaks. In the 10 s on-task trial
                    time condition, each circle is separated by a break, even if the line connects them. B) The y-axis
                    shows the amount of RT improvement after the rest. The x-axis indicates the amount of on-task trial
                    time, whereas the color indicates the amount of break time. Holding the amount of on-task trial time
                    constant (x-axis), break time has a strong effect on the amount of RT improvement. When the break
                    time (color) is held constant, on-task trial time also has a strong effect on RT improvement. Error
                    bars in standard error. <br><br>
