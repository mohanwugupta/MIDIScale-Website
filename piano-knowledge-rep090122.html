                    Piano Knowledge Representation and Generalization
                </h2>
                <p class=text>
                    We don’t know how piano knowledge is represented in the mind;
                    how does learning on one piece transfer to learning on another piece;
                    Can we use AI to generate practice exercises to get the user from learning state A
                    to desired learning state B. <br><br>

                    These ideas are the forefront of research and will modernize the learning experience.
                    So thank you again for coming on this journey with me and paving the way to make
                    learning a more equitable experience. <br><br>

                    Lebron James, one of the best basketball players of all time, and Jacob Collier,
                    a highly awarded musician, are at the edge of human ability in their respective fields.
                    Critical to accomplishing their striking feats are their finely tuned motor skills that
                    have been honed through rigorous practice. This prompts two questions, are some forms of
                    practice better than others and how do representations of knowledge change over time? Piano
                    playing provides an ideal case study for investigating how humans learn a complex motor skill.
                    To play moving melodies and crisp chords learners must train their mind and hands to accomplish
                    this goal. What is the optimal training regime to get to this point? There are several
                    hypotheses that may achieve this goal: 1) The low-generalization hypothesis assumes practice
                    only benefits learning on the practiced exercise or piece at hand. 2) The high-generalization
                    hypothesis assumes that all practice is equally beneficial. 3) On the other hand, a skill
                    hypothesis assumes that there are specific skills that can be trained and generalized to
                    enhance future learning. In the simplest form, these skills take the form of rhythmicity,
                    playing notes on time, and tonal accuracy, playing the correct note. Concretely, these different
                    forms of practice may look like 1) someone who practices on a variety of piano pieces to practice
                    as many scenarios as possible, 2) someone who only practices on one piano piece, 3) someone
                    who practices on specific skills like rhythmicity and timing in a variety of contexts.
                    Currently, there has been no systematic study probing different training styles that tap into
                    humans’
                    cognitive architecture to learn the piano. Furthering our understanding of how our mind’s
                    cognitive architecture digests information learned during practice is key to enhancing
                    pedagogy and figuring out how the mind represents knowledge. In Aim 1, we will address a
                    fundamental question of how piano knowledge is represented over time and the structure of
                    this knowledge. Aim 2 will address how prior learning generalizes and affects future learning.
                    Aim 3 will investigate how personalized exercises can be generated to prevent learners from
                    generating future errors. All findings will be shared through publications and conference
                    presentations. Data, code, and the pre-registration of the study will be uploaded to a public
                    repository such as OSF. <br><br>

                    Aim 1: Changes in piano knowledge representation. As a learner increases their skill in piano, how
                    they represent knowledge about playing will change and understanding these changes will lay
                    foundational work for understanding how to optimize the future practice of a learner. We can
                    understand how knowledge representation changes over time by examining the errors learners make.
                    Take the simple example of playing a C-major chord. The first time a learner plays it, they could
                    make an error due to not fully knowing what notes make up the C-major chord. Overtime, errors due to
                    this nature significantly decrease in likelihood. Other possible errors may arise due to selecting
                    the wrong hand configuration to play the chord or through a motor execution error. Learning must
                    occur in all of these cases to play the C-major chord. The non-generalization hypothesis predicts
                    that learning C-major in one exercise will fail to transfer to a future exercise. The
                    high-generalization hypothesis predicts that learning C-major in one exercise will generalize to all
                    situations and to future learning of similar chords. The skill hypothesis predicts that learning
                    C-major in one context will generalize only to contexts in which the tonal position and timing are
                    similar across exercises. This simple example can be expanded to other necessary skills like
                    learning a finger tuck, a motor skill necessary for playing scales. Using a dataset from Melodics, a
                    software that teaches piano using exercises, we will categorize types of errors as either tonal
                    (e.g. playing E instead of C) or as timing errors. In Melodics, users complete diverse exercises
                    that train different motor and musical skills. The figure shows what participants see while playing
                    an exercise. The learner has a physical keyboard while they look at virtual notes that move in time
                    towards them. The learner must play current notes while looking ahead to prepare to play future
                    notes. Inevitably while learning new exercises, the learner will make errors. For new exercises that
                    employ priorly learned chords, the low-generalization hypothesis predicts errors will be high at the
                    beginning of each exercise because prior learning will not transfer to new exercises. The
                    high-generalization hypothesis predicts that as the amount of overall practice time increases,
                    errors will decrease for all pieces of the same difficulty. The skill hypothesis predicts two
                    possible outcomes. 1) tonal and timing learning increase in parallel and both timing and tonal
                    errors reduce over time. 2) tonal learning must occur before timing learning and once tonal errors
                    have sufficiently reduced, timing errors will then decrease. These findings will reveal how changes
                    in errors are reflective of internal representations of piano skill.<br><br>

                    Using the categorized errors, we will examine how prior experience and practice affect future
                    performance. To do this, we will train an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict learners’
                    future errors on a novel exercise. The ANN will train on learners’ previously practiced exercises.
                    Once the ANN is trained on the practice history of individuals, it will be used to predict future
                    behavior of learners on novel exercises: 1) Tonal errors, 2) timing errors. Further, based on a
                    learner’s performance on a novel exercise, we can ask the ANN to predict, 3) how long has the
                    learner been practicing, and 4) have they practiced on a specific exercise. Successful prediction on
                    the first two metrics will support the conclusions that learning sub-skills like tonal and timing,
                    are essential for piano learning, supporting the skill-hypothesis. Successful prediction of the last
                    two metrics would support the high-generalization hypothesis. This will be the first
                    characterization of piano learning across thousands of people and these analyses will enable future
                    insights on piano pedagogy. Further, this work will be an initial step to creating a robot that will
                    learn to play the piano like humans do. <br><br>

                    Aim 2: Learning generalization. For the past century, piano learners have been using Hanon exercises
                    that are supposed to train essential piano motor skills2. However, these exercises have not been
                    validated and it is unclear if/what specific sub-skills they are training. Taking the simple example
                    from earlier of learning how to play a C-major chord, does learning how to play this chord help with
                    learning to play other chords like D-major or B-minor? Using the ANN trained in aim 1, we can
                    investigate what exercises and learned information are necessary for predicting future performance.
                    Concretely, to predict future tonal errors, what information did the ANN use to make that
                    prediction? How the ANN represents information cannot be interpreted directly so we must infer how
                    it makes decisions by changing the information it was trained on. We will ablate timing errors by
                    artificially correcting them in the dataset the ANN is trained on. If this information is important
                    for the ANN to make predictions about tonal errors, this will indicate that tonal knowledge is
                    necessary to learn timing information. We will use this same methodology to probe timing knowledge
                    as well. There are a couple of possible outcomes: 1) timing errors influence the ANN’s ability to
                    predict future tonal errors and vice versa. 2) Timing errors fail to influence the ANN’s ability to
                    predict future tonal errors and vice versa. If the first outcome is true, this would suggest that
                    these two skills may be part of a hierarchical structure of skill learning. However, if the second
                    outcome is true, this would suggest that learning timing and tonal skill learning are orthogonal to
                    each other and develop independently. Ultimately, these findings will further our understanding of
                    what information is essential for superior future performance. <br><br>

                    Aim 3: Generating Optimal Practice. An essential part of practice is ensuring that errors are not
                    repeated in the future. What would be the optimal practice to achieve this goal? Ideally,
                    personalized tutoring and practice for each learner is superior to general curricula. Using our
                    findings from aims 1 & 2, we will create an ANN that recommends exercises that will rectify
                    prevalent errors in a learner. This recommender system is similar to the one that video streaming
                    services like Netflix use to recommend new movies based on what the users have watched in the past.
                    For example, if a learner is generating many errors in exercises that are in the scale of C-major,
                    the ANN will recognize this and assign exercises to rectify these errors. However, in piano
                    learning, the recommender system would be limited to an existing set of exercises and would not take
                    into account musical preferences of the learner. To further expand personalized training, we will
                    build an ANN that can generate an infinite number of exercises that develop learning of specific
                    skills. Further, the exercises’ style will be to the learner’s preference. For example, if a learner
                    likes jazz and would prefer to have all of their exercises in a jazz style, we could transform
                    exercises like the Hanon exercises to fit their preference: jazz Hanon. <br><br>
